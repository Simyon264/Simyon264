### Hello there 👋!

My name is Simon and I live in Germany.\
I know **JS/TS**, **Python**, a *bit* of **Lua**, **SQL**, **HTML**.\
Very good with **C#**.

I am also a Lead Maintainer on Space Station 14.

*If I can do something in C#, I will do it in C#.*\
(C# is **not** holding me hostage *blinks rapidly*)
